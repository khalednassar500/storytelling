            May your Will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven. Greetings fellow
            Earthlings. I Am Charly, an American who has been living full time
            in Bali Indonesia for the past 28 years in a dimension way beyond
            imagination. What is happening now on Earth for everyone, which I Am
            partly responsible for, I went through successfully 28 years ago on
            my own, and I am feeling now it is the time for me to come out into
            the world either physically or metaphysically and suggest a way that
            they can help themselves get through this transition everyone on
            this planet is in at the moment. The following will take you about 9
            minutes to read through but might be worth your while. I am being
            advised to disengage using these handphones and the social
            communications platforms that they are all connected up to that
            operate and are controlled by artificial intelligence which intends
            to directly operate and control all of humanity in the near future.
            I will continue using email for the moment at this same address:
            HeavensOutpost.org@gmail.com But before I depart this WA platform I
            feel I should invite you to join me on a quantum level platform that
            manifested itself in physical forms 3 years ago on 2 sacred lands
            that I Am custodian of in Bali. These 2 physical /metaphysical
            platforms appear to be the catalyst and steering wheel of what is
            happening in this world now with me standing all alone at this wheel
            on the ship of Fortune.

          <p>
            If you have any interest in creating a new world that you envision
            as being Heaven on Earth for yourself and others, then read on, as
            you are most very welcome to board this Cosmic Ship platforn I’ve
            been on all alone for awhile so please, if you will, help steer it
            from wherever you are on this world into the future to the Heaven on
            Earth vision you want it to go, taking you into the future with it.
            As yes You have chosen to be here at this time in order to
            contribute your own unique point of view to the cast of conscious
            beings who are producing “the great spiritual awakening” on planet
            Earth. Your imagination is a priceless and handy tool for developing
            and exercising your attention toward creating what you want in this
            life. In imagination all thoughts are real. And let us call our cast
            of conscious creators of Heaven on Earth ‘The Quantum Exchange
            Coalition’. What all of mankind is going through on this planet at
            the moment is similar to what I went through successfully, on my
            own, 27 years ago. And now all of Humanity is deeply immersed in
            this ‘time of critical change’ I went through, and all on Earth are
            now poised at the threshold of a new understanding of the unlimited
            power of superlatively divine Cosmic Consciousness All I can say to
            all those now in this dark threshold corridor where I was, once upon
            a time, is either make it through to the way beyond imagination
            ‘other side’, which does exist and awaits you, or you will cease to
            exist. So just follow your Heart on how to proceed through this
            tumultuous transformation of human consciousness, the likes of which
            there is no recorded historical precedent for. As I wrote about over
            5 years ago in a story that explains what is now happening on Earth
            and the ‘other side’ that awaits you, I also mentioned that ‘Chris &
            Charlys’ intend to do all that we can to allow this new system to
            enter on the back of the old system Effortlessly in such a way as to
            inspire others to do the same. And What have we, Chris & Charlys,
            done so far after the story was written, we unintentionally
            manifested a working portal to this other dimension that, after
            activated, sent me to Wuhan China 4 years ago at the same time the
            Carona Virus was being unleashed there into the world.

        <section class="card" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">

          <p>
            In addition to this activated portal to the other dimension, Chris &
            Charlys also unintentionally manifested what I now refer to as one
            physical working physical form of Jacob’s Ladder Vision. And what I
            was also told 2 weeks before my Wuhan adventure, while at a dinner
            at Nihiwatu resort when the Chris of Chris & Charlys suddenly at the
            dinner table went into his impromptu shift of consciousness into a
            clairvoyant seer master for all those sitting near him at the table.
            A few of those 12 people at the table quickly got up and ran off,
            already knowing what type of seeing Chris enjoys doing. And that
            type of seeing usually means rooting around inside each person one
            at a time finding a dark closet in the basement and then dragging
            any dirty laundry found hidden in they’re out into the light for all
            at the table to see. So yes that is exactly what Chris the seer did
            to every person at the table before his clairvoyant awareness came
            to me. He looked me over quite well then started Laughing and said
            Ohhhh he’s from another planet, then he quickly moved his awareness
            on to the next person then suddenly came back to me and said “Ohhh
            one more thing, it’s like we are all on a boat and Charly is also on
            the boat with us sitting quietly way in the back and we should all
            be very happy that Charly is here on the boat with us because he
            will rescue all of us.” Then he moved on to the next person. I later
            discovered The main reason I was sent to Wuhan China 3 separate
            times before, during and after the release of the Carona virus
            pandemic was to be more like a facilitator, from another dimension,
            for something that had been in planning for many many decades and
            implemented by world leaders. I was also needed as a Cosmic
            frequency carrier to insert this Cosmic frequency emanating from the
            sacred island of Bali directly from the Cosmic Order into the
            physical world at the Ground Zero area of Wuhan China. And although
            those working under the instructions of an antiquated consciousness
            that created the old operating system of this planet, did accomplish
            the start of the worldwide pandemic scenario planned, it fortunately
            did not go as diabolically severe as they had planned and engineered
            it for. So in essence those who run the old system of operation on
            this planet of Earth will succeed in phase 1 of their new world
            order plan of first destroying the old system that was built
            centuries ago by the consciousness they still operate under. And for
            phase 1 that is all fine. The old system is no longer needed and
            should be destroyed by the consciousness that created it.

            But what they have planned for phase 2 will be all artificial
            intelligence and all of humanity will be vaccinated, chipped and
            hooked up into that matrix system. And that AI system does not
            contain what Superlatively Divine Cosmic Consciousness runs on. Love
            frequency, creativity and imagination. Imagination is, indeed, a
            ticket to ride on the mercurial carnival of Earth. To realize that
            you are a spiritual being is a key to the corridor of the future you
            seek. You must be aware that a process of spiritual evolution is
            occurring now, reality as you knew it is crumbling which is
            disturbing and upsetting to many. This present-day epoch involves
            the fall of global civilization and a re-awakening of a brand new
            form of consciousness. This is unheralded in our history. The time
            has come for all of humanity to wake up and open the time locks with
            keys of awakened consciousness and trigger the energy combinations
            that have been holding memories of ancient events until you can
            demonstrate that you are ready to receive them. When you infuse
            yourself with Cosmic light energy and surrender and work with
            intention in sacred sites, you literally send bolts of great change
            around the planet. Trust your inner guidance, for it will lead you
            along the various paths toward self knowledge, revealing the purpose
            of life and the basic meaning of existence. Your challenge is to
            comprehend what ‘your’ meaning of the prophesy ‘Thy shall be done on
            Earth as it is in Heaven’ exactly is, and then imagine yourself as a
            Jacob’s Ladder vision with your feet on the ground and your head at
            the top of the universe all at the same time. Can you hold that
            imagery? You are vast, and you are capable of connecting with the
            deepest cosmos and grounding it into Earth. Whatever you intend to
            make as your signature —your mark on this new Heaven on Earth
            world—it shall be. So, dream big and may you live that dream.

            There were codes of conduct by which people lived in ancient times.
            In Delphi, to “Know Thyself” was considered the key to living. Earth
            is on a course that is taking a radical change in direction. She is
            experiencing an accelerated thrust in the ongoing evolutionary
            process. A cycle is coming to completion and a new age or new theme
            is about to take precedence upon Earth. As Earth is being catapulted
            in a new direction, many of the occupants may perish because they do
            not meet the new speed at which Earth will vibrate anew. So now I
            Invite you to be one of the Founding Members of this new system of
            Heaven on Earth and be on the Steering Committee which will be
            called: ‘The Quantum Exchange Continuum.’ Your name will be engraved
            on the Founding Members Tablet attached to Jacob’s Ladder Vision
            physical manifestation and the Portal to the Golden Dimension both
            already here in Bali and fully activated and manifestation in many
            more locations around the world coming soon. Your Vision of what
            Heaven on Earth will be like, can remain a secret to the Quantum
            Exchange Coalition. The only requirement for you to be effective in
            the steering committee of the Quantum Exchange Coalition is you must
            agree to become fully connected / United with your higher Self
            (Awakened, Realized, Enlightened) Once you join the Quantum Exchange
            Continuum this requirement will happen within you automatically so
            after joining, sit down, shut up and hang on for the ride of your
            life.

          <p>
            So now all you have to do to join this ‘Quantum Exchange Continuum’
            is take a deep breath, then send me a message agreeing to be a
            member of the steering committee of the Heaven on Earth transition
            this planet is currently on the path to becoming, if you so ‘Will it
            to Be.’ And also agree to fully connect / Unite your lower self with
            your higher self. The true meaning of that requirement can be found
            in the Bible and in other religions ‘Seek yee first the Kingdom of
            Heaven and all else Will be added unto Thee.’ There is no monetary
            charge for you to become a member here but since we are all still
            operating under the old system using fiat currency then if you feel
            like it and can afford it then please donate whatever you feel it’s
            worth in Fiat currency to be a member of The Quantum Exchange
            Coalition. And according to Quantum Laws, whatever you put into
            something returns to you multiplied in and through many unimaginable
            ways. We have a PayPal account: HeavensOutpost.Org@gmail.com And if
            you feel like joining but do not feel like donating any fiat
            currency to this project, that is ok also. As once you join with
            donation or no donation I will personally send you by email the
            letter I wrote to the author of the book ‘Pay it Forward’ which
            tells the real story of how the ‘Pay it Forward’ worldwide phenomena
            began?<br /><br />
            Thanks for your attention. <br />Love Always Charly

          <p>
            Hi Dear Catherine, And greetings fellow Earthling.When I heard about
            the Pay it Forward book, film and Foundation 3.5 years ago I decided
            there was no reason to contact you to satisfy a curiosity that arose
            within me back in December 1996 when I first discovered Sydda Yoga
            suddenly was fully promotinga new idea called Pay it forward. The
            same nameless idea that had entered my field of awareness 3 or 4
            months earlier while I was helping someone change his tire on the
            side of the highway in Southern California. But now that all human
            civilizations on this planet are going through, what appears to be
            and what I would call a major transitional phase for all of humanity
            into something much better. The same transitional phase place I went
            through on my own in 1997 and managed to make it through
            miraculously to the other side within 2 months. And still having
            full memory of that journey I feel there will be countless
            multitudes of humans who can not make it through this transitional
            phase / dark tunnel, and the Cosmic rule is simple, either make it
            through to the other side or cease to exist. So I am now being
            instructed to come out from hiding and tell the story that happened
            to me after helping that stranded man in Sept of 96 on the side of
            the road in California change his tire. And by sharing my story
            perhaps it will inspire others to do the same as I did and make it
            through to Heaven on Earth. And that is why I feel I should contact
            you now just to make sure a part of my story does not interfere with
            your answer of how your ‘Pay itForward’ idea started.And of course
            your ‘first part’ answer to that question is very beautiful, full,
            explicit and complete of your car on fire problem in 1978. But the
            2nd part of your answer that you told of after your car fire problem
            had been fixed but the 2 people who stopped to help you had
            disappeared, Sosince then you have been on the lookout for others
            broke down on the side of the road, which to me,compared to that
            wonderful first part of the story, this 2nd part feels so very empty
            and incomplete.
          </p>

        <section class="card" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">
          <img src="./assets/g2.svg" />
          <p>
            If that second part of your story had a mention of when you actually
            did stop to help a person in need and told what you helped that
            person with, what you were thinking during that helping and then
            most important, how you told them and instructed them how to Pay it
            Forward and even more important, their amazing reaction to that
            strange instruction, then I would not need to send you this message.
            Ok Catherine so here is how that tire changing event that happened
            to me in Sept of 1996, that actually did change my life and the
            world I live in, will be written. And What you are about to read “Is
            the Truth, the whole Truth and nothing but the Truth so help me God.
            One morning at the end of the summer of 1996, I was driving on the
            405 Highway to Santa Barbara from San Diego where I just had a
            business meeting the night before with a friend from Saudi Arabia. I
            was trying to raise $50,000 funding money for another new product
            project I was working on in China. That meeting did not turn out too
            well and I still desperately needed $50,000 to send to the factory
            in China to begin the new project. So while driving back to Santa
            Barbara I started praying and asking God for help in finding the
            money I needed to send to China to save my business which was in
            danger of collapse without this new project starting soon. So while
            praying and driving the car I noticed up ahead there was a car
            parked on the side of the highway and a man standing beside the car
            waving at me while I approached his location. I assumed his car must
            have broken down, needed help and he did not have a cell phone to
            call for help.So I pulled up behind his car which looked like an
            antique Mercedes Benz in such superlatively pristine condition and
            then the very well dressed older man with white hair standing beside
            the car, looked at me and started walking toward my car. Wow! I
            thought. This must be the answer to my prayer and I felt for sure
            this man is going to tell me he has $50,000 in the trunk of his car
            for me.When he got to my carhe thanked me for stopping and, pointing
            to his car, says “I have a flat tire.” My high expectation just
            crashed and burned at that moment.

          <p>
            I took a deep breath and replied, Ok well if you have a spare tire,
            I can help you with that.He said yes, so I got out of my car and
            walked with him back to his car.The closer we got to his antique
            Mercedes the more beautiful it looked. It was in brand new
            condition! He then opened his trunk and inside this spotless trunk
            was only a set of golf clubs. He moved the golf bag of clubs aside
            and opened a compartment below revealing the spare tire in brand new
            condition.I pulled out the spare tire, lug wrench and jack and
            started changing the tire which I was very good at after much
            experience on my own cars. And during this tire changing the voice
            in my mind was telling me, “Ohhh how this is going to change your
            life...”. “Huh?” I thoughtfully replied, I can not ask this man for
            $50,000, (in todays time that would be around $200,000). I thought
            more about asking the man for the money while the voice in my mind
            kept on harping over and over again the “Ohhhhhow this is going to
            change your life”. Then I just had to inform this voice in my mind,
            “There is no way I will ask this man for $50,000 or even a small
            amount of money. I will do it for no charge and will feel happier
            that way. I will consider thisjust a simple act of selfless service
            called Seva that I’ve learned and practiced while being a part of
            Syda Yoga the past ten years. Then I envisioned this thought forward
            a bit. I saw myself finishing changing the tire, placing the flat
            tire and other tools back neatly in his spotless trunk and then
            telling him happy to help, and you owe me nothing. I then saw him
            become slightly upset and saying Oh come on! I have to give you
            something for stopping to help me. Then I saw myself explaining that
            what I just helped you with is considered selfless service / Seva,
            which he did not understand also. Hmmmmm I thought. How else can I
            best conclude this Seva event.After some pondering while attaching
            his new tire to his car. A better way popped into my head while
            screwing in the lug nuts of the tire. I will tell him, You owe me
            nothing for helping you with yourcurrent problem of a flat tire. And
            if you feel you need to give me something for this help,then a
            better way of giving, will present itself in the future when you
            will run across someone else that needs help with something that
            they are not able to do but you are. So you just help that person
            and preferably a total stranger, not a friend or family member. And
            then once you’ve completed that ‘helping’ you tell that person the
            same thing I am telling you now and make sure you tell that person
            to help someone else that needs help in the future.And if this act
            of helping givesyou a beautiful feeling then do it again and
            again.When I then envisioned him doing the same thing I am doing to
            him now, this system of helping others mushroomed beautifully all
            over the world and the feeling in my heart of how successful this
            would become was astounding beyond imagination. But of course there
            can be no name or ownership of this system of helping others and no
            monetary profits to be made from this. So even though I’d just came
            up with another amazing invention, it does not solve my 50,000
            problem.Anyway I could feel the way this tire changing service at no
            charge will conclude looks.So I finished changing his tire, put the
            flat tire and tools back neatly in trunk, closed it, then looked at
            him standing there smiling. I told him ok you’re all good to go.

            He walked closer to me putting his hand in his pocket pulling out a
            wad of cash asking how much do I owe you. I just laughed waving my
            hand and said oh no, I did not stop to help you with this looking
            forpayment from you. I’m happy I could help you and smiled back at
            him,thinking I should tell him to help someone else in the future
            but suddenly realized it might sound more like a demand so I kept
            quiet about that part hoping it was now completed.But then exactly
            as I had envisioned moments before, he looked a little upset and
            said oh come on, I feel I have to reward you for helping me like
            this.Then I knew I had to tell him the second part, no way around
            it.Ok, I said, how about like this; Instead of rewarding me for
            helping you with something you could not do by yourself then in the
            future I’m sure you will come across someone who needs help with
            something that they can not do by themself but you can. Then just
            help that person the best you can and preferably not a friend or
            family member, a complete stranger.Then after you’ve completed
            helping them, you tell them what I am telling you now. Just help a
            stranger in the future. And if it felt good to do that then do it
            again and again as you wish.He then looked a bit confused so I
            explained it again, adding that everybody has a unique talent that
            can benefit others so go out into the world and share your talent
            with others and tell those others to share their talents with
            others.Then he suddenly got it and looked so surprised holding the
            sides of hishead,saying,Oh Wow!this is the Greatest thing I’ve ever
            been told to do! Then walked away looking down at the ground still
            deep in thought then looked up and started dancing and hopping
            around the car so enthused at what I just imposed on him to do inthe
            future.

            I needed to get back on the road and back to Santa Barbara so I
            walked back to my car and just before getting in the man yells at me
            Hey!! Thank you so much for helping me and giving me my new
            assignment.There needs to be more people inthe world like you!!!I
            waved goodbye, got back in my car, watched him drive off, then I
            could feel I really inspired him to follow through of what I told
            him to do but of course I’m sitting here with the same money problem
            I had before I stopped. But soon after that, just as the voice in my
            head kept saying, my life did change in a big and unimaginable way.I
            just happened to be in NY 1996 a bit before Christmas for 2 days
            preparing to fly out to Hong Kong to begin the new China project I’d
            been working on the past few months and finally found funding here
            in NY so I decided to go up to the Fallsburg Syddah Ashram in New
            York State the day before flying off to Hong Kong. And when I
            arrived at the Syddah Ashram that morning I found all the devotees
            so busy preparing for some sort of big celebration. Hanging up many
            colorful balloons and so much more decorations making the Ashram
            look so spectacular.So I asked one of the senior staff there, what
            is going on? Christmas party celebration preparations? She looked
            surprised and said “Oh noooo, this is all for an amazing new project
            Sydda Yoga will become fully involved with. It’s when for example,
            if you help someone who needs help with something very important,
            instead of asking that person to pay you back, you ask them to help
            2 people they find in the future who needs help with something and
            it’s called Pay it Forward.”

        <section class="card" data-aos="fade-up" data-aos-duration="1000">
          <img src="./assets/g6.svg" />
          <p>
            When I heard that, I thought Oh Wow! That is almost exactly the same
            instructions I was instructed to tell someone 3 months ago, after
            much argument with my higher self, to tell to an older and probably
            a very wealthy man when I stopped on the side of the big highway,
            not too far north of San Diego on my way back to Santa Barbara.So my
            brain kicked in and I startedthinking is it possible that the
            elderly man, who I helped in California 3 or 4 months ago who seemed
            very excited after I fixed his flat tire problem and told him what
            he needed to do next, actually followed through with my
            instructions?Nooo impossible, I concluded, as now it has a name ‘Pay
            it Forward’ and there is now a requirement to help in the future 2
            people. So I then asked the woman, when and how this Pay it Forward
            project started in Syddah Yoga? And she said “Oh just recently a
            couple living in California told this idea to the Santa Monica Sydda
            meditation center and when Gurumayi, the Guru heard about it, she
            says it touched her heart so much she decided to promote it in a big
            way in the Syddah Yoga centers all over the world. Oh Wow! this is
            sounding so much like that elderly man I helped really did go out
            and spread this idea in California that quickly found its way to the
            Sydda Yoga center in Santa Monica which is great but if the Guru
            knew the idea that so much touched her heart actually originated
            from me then Maybe she might feel like rewarding me with what I and
            all others in Sydda Yoga are searching for, instant Enlightenment.
            So I decided right then and there, when I return from Hong Kong in a
            few weeks I will fly back to LA and visit the Santa Monica Sydda
            center and try and trace back this Pay it Forward project and see if
            it really did somehow come from that elderly man I helped.So I left
            the next day to Hong Kong and then once there, that is when ‘it’
            happened,the prophesy I kept receiving in my head, over and over
            again during my argument with my higher self while changing that
            elderly man’s tire 3 or 4 months before, that this tire change would
            change my life forever in a great way. The ultimate transition
            happened and I never really went back home to America ever again.

              May your Will be done on Earth as it is in Heaven. Greetings
              fellow Earthlings. I Am Charly, an American who has been living
              full time in Bali Indonesia for the past 28 years in a dimension
              way beyond imagination. What is happening now on Earth for
              everyone, which I Am partly responsible for, I went through
              successfully 28 years ago on my own, and I am feeling now it is
              the time for me to come out into the world either physically or
              metaphysically and suggest a way that they can help themselves get
              through this transition everyone on this planet is in at the
              moment. The following will take you about 9 minutes to read
              through but might be worth your while. I am being advised to
              disengage using these handphones and the social communications
              platforms that they are all connected up to that operate and are
              controlled by artificial intelligence which intends to directly
              operate and control all of humanity in the near future. I will
              continue using email for the moment at this same address:
              HeavensOutpost.org@gmail.com But before I depart this WA platform
              I feel I should invite you to join me on a quantum level platform
              that manifested itself in physical forms 3 years ago on 2 sacred
              lands that I Am custodian of in Bali. These 2 physical
              /metaphysical platforms appear to be the catalyst and steering
              wheel of what is happening in this world now with me standing all
              alone at this wheel on the ship of Fortune.If you have any
              interest in creating a new world that you envision as being Heaven
              on Earth for yourself and others, then read on, as you are most
              very welcome to board this Cosmic Ship platforn I’ve been on all
              alone for awhile so please, if you will, help steer it from
              wherever you are on this world into the future to the Heaven on
              Earth vision you want it to go, taking you into the future with
              it.

              As yes You have chosen to be here at this time in order to
              contribute your own unique point of view to the cast of conscious
              beings who are producing “the great spiritual awakening” on planet
              Earth. Your imagination is a priceless and handy tool for
              developing and exercising your attention toward creating what you
              want in this life. In imagination all thoughts are real. And let
              us call our cast of conscious creators of Heaven on Earth ‘The
              Quantum Exchange Coalition’. What all of mankind is going through
              on this planet at the moment is similar to what I went through
              successfully, on my own, 27 years ago. And now all of Humanity is
              deeply immersed in this ‘time of critical change’ I went through,
              and all on Earth are now poised at the threshold of a new
              understanding of the unlimited power of superlatively divine
              Cosmic Consciousness All I can say to all those now in this dark
              threshold corridor where I was, once upon a time, is either make
              it through to the way beyond imagination ‘other side’, which does
              exist and awaits you, or you will cease to exist. So just follow
              your Heart on how to proceed through this tumultuous
              transformation of human consciousness, the likes of which there is
              no recorded historical precedent for. As I wrote about over 5
              years ago in a story that explains what is now happening on Earth
              and the ‘other side’ that awaits you, I also mentioned that ‘Chris
              & Charlys’ intend to do all that we can to allow this new system
              to enter on the back of the old system Effortlessly in such a way
              as to inspire others to do the same. And What have we, Chris &
              Charlys, done so far after the story was written, we
              unintentionally manifested a working portal to this other
              dimension that, after activated, sent me to Wuhan China 4 years
              ago at the same time the Carona Virus was being unleashed there
              into the world.

            <p>
              In addition to this activated portal to the other dimension, Chris
              & Charlys also unintentionally manifested what I now refer to as
              one physical working physical form of Jacob’s Ladder Vision. And
              what I was also told 2 weeks before my Wuhan adventure, while at a
              dinner at Nihiwatu resort when the Chris of Chris & Charlys
              suddenly at the dinner table went into his impromptu shift of
              consciousness into a clairvoyant seer master for all those sitting
              near him at the table. A few of those 12 people at the table
              quickly got up and ran off, already knowing what type of seeing
              Chris enjoys doing. And that type of seeing usually means rooting
              around inside each person one at a time finding a dark closet in
              the basement and then dragging any dirty laundry found hidden in
              they’re out into the light for all at the table to see. So yes
              that is exactly what Chris the seer did to every person at the
              table before his clairvoyant awareness came to me. He looked me
              over quite well then started Laughing and said Ohhhh he’s from
              another planet, then he quickly moved his awareness on to the next
              person then suddenly came back to me and said “Ohhh one more
              thing, it’s like we are all on a boat and Charly is also on the
              boat with us sitting quietly way in the back and we should all be
              very happy that Charly is here on the boat with us because he will
              rescue all of us.” Then he moved on to the next person. I later
              discovered The main reason I was sent to Wuhan China 3 separate
              times before, during and after the release of the Carona virus
              pandemic was to be more like a facilitator, from another
              dimension, for something that had been in planning for many many
              decades and implemented by world leaders. I was also needed as a
              Cosmic frequency carrier to insert this Cosmic frequency emanating
              from the sacred island of Bali directly from the Cosmic Order into
              the physical world at the Ground Zero area of Wuhan China.

            <p>
              And although those working under the instructions of an antiquated
              consciousness that created the old operating system of this
              planet, did accomplish the start of the worldwide pandemic
              scenario planned, it fortunately did not go as diabolically severe
              as they had planned and engineered it for. So in essence those who
              run the old system of operation on this planet of Earth will
              succeed in phase 1 of their new world order plan of first
              destroying the old system that was built centuries ago by the
              consciousness they still operate under. And for phase 1 that is
              all fine. The old system is no longer needed and should be
              destroyed by the consciousness that created it. But what they have
              planned for phase 2 will be all artificial intelligence and all of
              humanity will be vaccinated, chipped and hooked up into that
              matrix system. And that AI system does not contain what
              Superlatively Divine Cosmic Consciousness runs on. Love frequency,
              creativity and imagination. Imagination is, indeed, a ticket to
              ride on the mercurial carnival of Earth. To realize that you are a
              spiritual being is a key to the corridor of the future you seek.
              You must be aware that a process of spiritual evolution is
              occurring now, reality as you knew it is crumbling which is
              disturbing and upsetting to many. This present-day epoch involves
              the fall of global civilization and a re-awakening of a brand new
              form of consciousness. This is unheralded in our history. The time
              has come for all of humanity to wake up and open the time locks
              with keys of awakened consciousness and trigger the energy
              combinations that have been holding memories of ancient events
              until you can demonstrate that you are ready to receive them. When
              you infuse yourself with Cosmic light energy and surrender and
              work with intention in sacred sites, you literally send bolts of
              great change around the planet.

              Trust your inner guidance, for it will lead you along the various
              paths toward self knowledge, revealing the purpose of life and the
              basic meaning of existence. Your challenge is to comprehend what
              ‘your’ meaning of the prophesy ‘Thy shall be done on Earth as it
              is in Heaven’ exactly is, and then imagine yourself as a Jacob’s
              Ladder vision with your feet on the ground and your head at the
              top of the universe all at the same time. Can you hold that
              imagery? You are vast, and you are capable of connecting with the
              deepest cosmos and grounding it into Earth. Whatever you intend to
              make as your signature —your mark on this new Heaven on Earth
              world—it shall be. So, dream big and may you live that dream.
              There were codes of conduct by which people lived in ancient
              times. In Delphi, to “Know Thyself” was considered the key to
              living. Earth is on a course that is taking a radical change in
              direction. She is experiencing an accelerated thrust in the
              ongoing evolutionary process. A cycle is coming to completion and
              a new age or new theme is about to take precedence upon Earth. As
              Earth is being catapulted in a new direction, many of the
              occupants may perish because they do not meet the new speed at
              which Earth will vibrate anew. So now I Invite you to be one of
              the Founding Members of this new system of Heaven on Earth and be
              on the Steering Committee which will be called: ‘The Quantum
              Exchange Continuum.’ Your name will be engraved on the Founding
              Members Tablet attached to Jacob’s Ladder Vision physical
              manifestation and the Portal to the Golden Dimension both already
              here in Bali and fully activated and manifestation in many more
              locations around the world coming soon. Your Vision of what Heaven
              on Earth will be like, can remain a secret to the Quantum Exchange
              Coalition.

            <p>
              The only requirement for you to be effective in the steering
              committee of the Quantum Exchange Coalition is you must agree to
              become fully connected / United with your higher Self (Awakened,
              Realized, Enlightened) Once you join the Quantum Exchange
              Continuum this requirement will happen within you automatically so
              after joining, sit down, shut up and hang on for the ride of your
              life. So now all you have to do to join this ‘Quantum Exchange
              Continuum’ is take a deep breath, then send me a message agreeing
              to be a member of the steering committee of the Heaven on Earth
              transition this planet is currently on the path to becoming, if
              you so ‘Will it to Be.’ And also agree to fully connect / Unite
              your lower self with your higher self. The true meaning of that
              requirement can be found in the Bible and in other religions ‘Seek
              yee first the Kingdom of Heaven and all else Will be added unto
              Thee.’ There is no monetary charge for you to become a member here
              but since we are all still operating under the old system using
              fiat currency then if you feel like it and can afford it then
              please donate whatever you feel it’s worth in Fiat currency to be
              a member of The Quantum Exchange Coalition. And according to

              but do not feel like donating any fiat currency to this project,
              that is ok also. As once you join with donation or no donation I

              ‘Pay it Forward’ worldwide phenomena began? Thanks for your
              attention. <br />Love Always Charly

            <p>
              Hi Dear Catherine, And greetings fellow Earthling.When I heard
              about the Pay it Forward book, film and Foundation 3.5 years ago I
              decided there was no reason to contact you to satisfy a curiosity
              that arose within me back in December 1996 when I first discovered
              Sydda Yoga suddenly was fully promotinga new idea called Pay it
              forward. The same nameless idea that had entered my field of
              awareness 3 or 4 months earlier while I was helping someone change
              his tire on the side of the highway in Southern California. But
              now that all human civilizations on this planet are going through,
              what appears to be and what I would call a major transitional
              phase for all of humanity into something much better. The same
              transitional phase place I went through on my own in 1997 and
              managed to make it through miraculously to the other side within 2
              months. And still having full memory of that journey I feel there
              will be countless multitudes of humans who can not make it through
              this transitional phase / dark tunnel, and the Cosmic rule is
              simple, either make it through to the other side or cease to
              exist. So I am now being instructed to come out from hiding and
              tell the story that happened to me after helping that stranded man
              in Sept of 96 on the side of the road in California change his
              tire. And by sharing my story perhaps it will inspire others to do
              the same as I did and make it through to Heaven on Earth. And that
              is why I feel I should contact you now just to make sure a part of
              my story does not interfere with your answer of how your ‘Pay
              itForward’ idea started.And of course your ‘first part’ answer to
              that question is very beautiful, full, explicit and complete of
              your car on fire problem in 1978.
            </p>
          </section>

          <section class="card">
            <img src="./assets/g2.svg" />
            <p>
              But the 2nd part of your answer that you told of after your car
              fire problem had been fixed but the 2 people who stopped to help
              you had disappeared, Sosince then you have been on the lookout for
              others broke down on the side of the road, which to me,compared to
              that wonderful first part of the story, this 2nd part feels so
              very empty and incomplete. If that second part of your story had a
              mention of when you actually did stop to help a person in need and
              told what you helped that person with, what you were thinking
              during that helping and then most important, how you told them and
              instructed them how to Pay it Forward and even more important,
              their amazing reaction to that strange instruction, then I would
              not need to send you this message. Ok Catherine so here is how
              that tire changing event that happened to me in Sept of 1996, that
              actually did change my life and the world I live in, will be
              written. And What you are about to read “Is the Truth, the whole
              Truth and nothing but the Truth so help me God. One morning at the
              end of the summer of 1996, I was driving on the 405 Highway to
              Santa Barbara from San Diego where I just had a business meeting
              the night before with a friend from Saudi Arabia. I was trying to
              raise $50,000 funding money for another new product project I was
              working on in China. That meeting did not turn out too well and I
              still desperately needed $50,000 to send to the factory in China
              to begin the new project. So while driving back to Santa Barbara I
              started praying and asking God for help in finding the money I
              needed to send to China to save my business which was in danger of
              collapse without this new project starting soon. So while praying
              and driving the car I noticed up ahead there was a car parked on
              the side of the highway and a man standing beside the car waving
              at me while I approached his location.
            </p>

          <section class="card">
            <img src="./assets/g3.svg" />
            <p>
              I assumed his car must have broken down, needed help and he did
              not have a cell phone to call for help.So I pulled up behind his
              car which looked like an antique Mercedes Benz in such
              superlatively pristine condition and then the very well dressed
              older man with white hair standing beside the car, looked at me
              and started walking toward my car. Wow! I thought. This must be
              the answer to my prayer and I felt for sure this man is going to
              tell me he has $50,000 in the trunk of his car for me.When he got
              to my carhe thanked me for stopping and, pointing to his car, says
              “I have a flat tire.” My high expectation just crashed and burned
              at that moment. I took a deep breath and replied, Ok well if you
              have a spare tire, I can help you with that.He said yes, so I got
              out of my car and walked with him back to his car.The closer we
              got to his antique Mercedes the more beautiful it looked. It was
              in brand new condition! He then opened his trunk and inside this
              spotless trunk was only a set of golf clubs. He moved the golf bag
              of clubs aside and opened a compartment below revealing the spare
              tire in brand new condition.I pulled out the spare tire, lug
              wrench and jack and started changing the tire which I was very
              good at after much experience on my own cars. And during this tire
              changing the voice in my mind was telling me, “Ohhh how this is
              going to change your life...”. “Huh?” I thoughtfully replied, I
              can not ask this man for $50,000, (in todays time that would be
              around $200,000). I thought more about asking the man for the
              money while the voice in my mind kept on harping over and over
              again the “Ohhhhhow this is going to change your life”. Then I
              just had to inform this voice in my mind, “There is no way I will
              ask this man for $50,000 or even a small amount of money. I will
              do it for no charge and will feel happier that way.

              I will consider thisjust a simple act of selfless service called
              Seva that I’ve learned and practiced while being a part of Syda
              Yoga the past ten years. Then I envisioned this thought forward a
              bit. I saw myself finishing changing the tire, placing the flat
              tire and other tools back neatly in his spotless trunk and then
              telling him happy to help, and you owe me nothing. I then saw him
              become slightly upset and saying Oh come on! I have to give you
              something for stopping to help me. Then I saw myself explaining
              that what I just helped you with is considered selfless service /
              Seva, which he did not understand also. Hmmmmm I thought. How else
              can I best conclude this Seva event.After some pondering while
              attaching his new tire to his car. A better way popped into my
              head while screwing in the lug nuts of the tire. I will tell him,
              You owe me nothing for helping you with yourcurrent problem of a
              flat tire. And if you feel you need to give me something for this
              help,then a better way of giving, will present itself in the
              future when you will run across someone else that needs help with
              something that they are not able to do but you are. So you just
              help that person and preferably a total stranger, not a friend or
              family member. And then once you’ve completed that ‘helping’ you
              tell that person the same thing I am telling you now and make sure
              you tell that person to help someone else that needs help in the
              future.And if this act of helping givesyou a beautiful feeling
              then do it again and again.When I then envisioned him doing the
              same thing I am doing to him now, this system of helping others
              mushroomed beautifully all over the world and the feeling in my
              heart of how successful this would become was astounding beyond
              imagination. But of course there can be no name or ownership of
              this system of helping others and no monetary profits to be made
              from this.

              So even though I’d just came up with another amazing invention, it
              does not solve my 50,000 problem.Anyway I could feel the way this
              tire changing service at no charge will conclude looks.So I
              finished changing his tire, put the flat tire and tools back
              neatly in trunk, closed it, then looked at him standing there
              smiling. I told him ok you’re all good to go. He walked closer to
              me putting his hand in his pocket pulling out a wad of cash asking
              how much do I owe you. I just laughed waving my hand and said oh
              no, I did not stop to help you with this looking forpayment from
              you. I’m happy I could help you and smiled back at him,thinking I
              should tell him to help someone else in the future but suddenly
              realized it might sound more like a demand so I kept quiet about
              that part hoping it was now completed.But then exactly as I had
              envisioned moments before, he looked a little upset and said oh
              come on, I feel I have to reward you for helping me like this.Then
              I knew I had to tell him the second part, no way around it.Ok, I
              said, how about like this; Instead of rewarding me for helping you
              with something you could not do by yourself then in the future I’m
              sure you will come across someone who needs help with something
              that they can not do by themself but you can. Then just help that
              person the best you can and preferably not a friend or family
              member, a complete stranger.Then after you’ve completed helping
              them, you tell them what I am telling you now. Just help a
              stranger in the future. And if it felt good to do that then do it
              again and again as you wish.He then looked a bit confused so I
              explained it again, adding that everybody has a unique talent that
              can benefit others so go out into the world and share your talent
              with others and tell those others to share their talents with
              others.Then he suddenly got it and looked so surprised holding the
              sides of hishead,saying,Oh Wow!this is the Greatest thing I’ve
              ever been told to do!

              Then walked away looking down at the ground still deep in thought
              then looked up and started dancing and hopping around the car so
              enthused at what I just imposed on him to do inthe future. I
              needed to get back on the road and back to Santa Barbara so I
              walked back to my car and just before getting in the man yells at
              me Hey!! Thank you so much for helping me and giving me my new
              assignment.There needs to be more people inthe world like you!!!I
              waved goodbye, got back in my car, watched him drive off, then I
              could feel I really inspired him to follow through of what I told
              him to do but of course I’m sitting here with the same money
              problem I had before I stopped. But soon after that, just as the
              voice in my head kept saying, my life did change in a big and
              unimaginable way.I just happened to be in NY 1996 a bit before
              Christmas for 2 days preparing to fly out to Hong Kong to begin
              the new China project I’d been working on the past few months and
              finally found funding here in NY so I decided to go up to the
              Fallsburg Syddah Ashram in New York State the day before flying
              off to Hong Kong. And when I arrived at the Syddah Ashram that
              morning I found all the devotees so busy preparing for some sort
              of big celebration. Hanging up many colorful balloons and so much
              more decorations making the Ashram look so spectacular.So I asked
              one of the senior staff there, what is going on? Christmas party
              celebration preparations? She looked surprised and said “Oh noooo,
              this is all for an amazing new project Sydda Yoga will become
              fully involved with. It’s when for example, if you help someone
              who needs help with something very important, instead of asking
              that person to pay you back, you ask them to help 2 people they
              find in the future who needs help with something and it’s called
              Pay it Forward.”When I heard that, I thought Oh Wow! That is
              almost exactly the same instructions I was instructed to tell
              someone 3 months ago, after much argument with my higher self,
            </p>
          </section>

          <section class="card">
            <img src="./assets/g6.svg" />
            <p>
              to tell to an older and probably a very wealthy man when I stopped
              on the side of the big highway, not too far north of San Diego on
              my way back to Santa Barbara.So my brain kicked in and I
              startedthinking is it possible that the elderly man, who I helped
              in California 3 or 4 months ago who seemed very excited after I
              fixed his flat tire problem and told him what he needed to do
              next, actually followed through with my instructions?Nooo
              impossible, I concluded, as now it has a name ‘Pay it Forward’ and
              there is now a requirement to help in the future 2 people. So I
              then asked the woman, when and how this Pay it Forward project
              started in Syddah Yoga? And she said “Oh just recently a couple
              living in California told this idea to the Santa Monica Sydda
              meditation center and when Gurumayi, the Guru heard about it, she
              says it touched her heart so much she decided to promote it in a
              big way in the Syddah Yoga centers all over the world. Oh Wow!
              this is sounding so much like that elderly man I helped really did
              go out and spread this idea in California that quickly found its
              way to the Sydda Yoga center in Santa Monica which is great but if
              the Guru knew the idea that so much touched her heart actually
              originated from me then Maybe she might feel like rewarding me
              with what I and all others in Sydda Yoga are searching for,
              instant Enlightenment. So I decided right then and there, when I
              return from Hong Kong in a few weeks I will fly back to LA and
              visit the Santa Monica Sydda center and try and trace back this
              Pay it Forward project and see if it really did somehow come from
              that elderly man I helped.So I left the next day to Hong Kong and
              then once there, that is when ‘it’ happened,the prophesy I kept
              receiving in my head, over and over again during my argument with
              my higher self while changing that elderly man’s tire 3 or 4
              months before, that this tire change would change my life forever
              in a great way. The ultimate transition happened and I never
              really went back home to America ever again.
